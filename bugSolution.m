The solution involves using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) effectively or manual memory management properly. For the memory leak issue, ensure that all allocated objects are properly released using `release` or by removing strong references.

For the delayed selector problem, a common solution is to use a `weak` reference to `self` inside the selector's target method: 

```objectivec
- (void)myMethod {
    [self performSelector:@selector(delayedMethod) withObject:nil afterDelay:2.0];
}

- (void)delayedMethod {
    __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self; //weak reference for preventing crashes
    if (weakSelf) {
      //Access properties of weakSelf
    }
}
```

For observer issues, always remove observers using `removeObserver:` when appropriate, often in `dealloc` method or when the observer is no longer needed.
