In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with objects that are not properly retained or released. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. Consider this example: 

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog (@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end

int main() {
    MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
    // ... some code where obj is used ...
    obj = nil; // Without releasing myString
    return 0;
}
```

In this scenario, `myString` is retained by `obj`. When `obj` is set to `nil`, `myString` is not released causing a memory leak. The `dealloc` method of `MyClass` won't be called if there are other strong references to `obj`.

Another potential issue lies in using `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` without considering the object's lifecycle. If the object is deallocated before the selector is executed, a crash will occur.  Proper handling of delegate methods and notifications is also vital; failing to remove observers when they are no longer needed can lead to crashes and unexpected behavior.
